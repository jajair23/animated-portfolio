        I'm an experienced Software Developer adept at building modern web applications and digital systems across all stages of development.
        My background includes leading QA teams, working with international clients, and creating dynamic, responsive websites and apps with tools like JavaScript, Tailwind, WordPress, PHP, Node.js, and Ruby.
        <br /><br />
        I've worked with companies like UPDigital Group, QA World, and Inspace, transforming Figma designs into production-ready code, integrating 3D web models, and optimizing pages for SEO and usability.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond tech, I hold degrees in Psychology, Sacred Music, and Theology. I'm also trilingual, a team player, and passionate about solving real-world problems with technology.
